## DISCLAIMER

* I don't consider myself good at coding, in fact this script is really not optimized, but at least it works. (if you can help me make it cleaner/better PM me)
* **Why did you create this bot ?** As a coach I feel like a lot of the time players are slacking in soloQ. And I cba'd counting every players games everyday on opgg, now I can do that with a simple command.
* **How did you create this bot ?** Using really basic League API & Python knowledge.
* **Who are you** ? I am Aries, coach for Team Oplon in the LFL

## Installation

The installation of the bot is fairly easy if you have programming knowledge, if you don't then it's longer, so I will do it for both:

## Installation (if you know how Python/League API)ðŸ’»

* From the Discord developer website, create an application & a bot, follow this tutorial: https://betterprogramming.pub/coding-a-discord-bot-with-python-64da9d6cade7
* Once your discord bot is loaded on your Team server, here are things that you need to modify in our python script:
`api_key = 'INSERT API KEY HERE' # here please put in-between the quotes your Riot API Developer Key` (line 11)
